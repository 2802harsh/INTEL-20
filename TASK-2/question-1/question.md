Transpose.

Create a numpy ndarray based on the TASK-1 Question-1 dataset. Select the first column and transpose it.
Take only first 25 entries into consideration.
Then reshape the transpose into a matrix / array of 5x5. Then print the inverse of the matrix.

Just write the code in python using the `numpy` library, and add that into the folder.

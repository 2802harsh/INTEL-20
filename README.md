Opencode'20 Machine Learning

### TASK-1

Task-1 consists of two questions. Both of them require you to apply Linear Regression on a dataset and submit working code and plots. You get separate points for the questions, which means if you complete only the first one, you still get 20 points.

We recommend you use Python 3 as the language and use its libraries - `sci-kit learn` and `matplotlib` to implement the ML model and make plots.
